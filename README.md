# ❗CSC226 Final Project

❗️Exclamation Marks ❗️indicate action items; you should remove these emoji as you complete/update the items which they accompany. (This means that your final README should have no ❗️in it!)

❗️**Author(s)**: Your names here

❗️**Google Doc Link**: Your link here

---

❗**References**: 
Throughout this project, you have likely used outside resources. Reference all ideas which are not your own, and describe how you integrated the ideas or code into your program. This includes online sources, people who have helped you, and any other resources that are not solely your own contribution. Update as you go.

## Milestone 1: Setup, Planning, Design

❗️**Title**: What is the title of your project?

❗**Purpose**: In a single sentence, describe what your project will do.

❗️**Sources**: Which assignments will you base your project on?

❗️**CRC Card(s)**:
  - Please write a CRC card for each class that your project will implement.
  - See this link for a sample CRC card and a template to
  use for your own cards (you will have to make a copy to edit): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JE_3Qmytk_JGztRqkPXWACJwciPH61VCx3idIlBCVFY/edit?usp=sharing
  - Tables in markdown are not easy, so we suggest saving your CRC card
  as an image and including the image(s) in the README. You can do this
  by saving an image in the repository and linking to it. See the sample CRC card below - and replace it with your own.

❗️**Branches**: This project will require effective use of git. 
Each partner should create a branch at the beginning of the project, and stay on this branch (or branches of this branch) as they work.
When you need to bring each others branches together, do so by merging each other's branches into your own. 
1. Branch 1 name: _____________
2. Branch 2 name: _____________

## Milestone 2: Code

No README action items. Keep your issue queue up to date, and focus on your code. 🙃

Your repository should have, at a minimum, two branches; one for each partner, each with their contributions. 

---

## Milestone 3: Virtual Check-In

Indicate what percentage of the project you have left to complete and how confident you feel. 

❗️**Completion Percentage**: 0 - 100%

❗️**Confidence**: Describe how confident you feel about completing this project, and why. Then, describe some strategies you can employ to increase the likelihood that you'll be successful in completing this project before the deadline.

❗️Keep your issue queue up to date, and continue to refine your code!

## Milestone 4: Final Code, Presentation, Demo

### ❗User Instructions
In a paragraph, explain how to use your program. Assume the user is starting just after they hit the "Run" button in PyCharm. 

### ❗Errors and Constraints
Every program has bugs or features that had to be scrapped for time. 
These bugs should be tracked in the issue queue. You should already have a few items in here from the prior weeks. 
Create a new issue for any undocumented errors and deficiencies that remain in your code. 
Bugs found that aren't acknowledged in the queue will be penalized.

### ❗Reflection
In three to four well-written paragraphs, address the following (at a minimum):
- Why did you select the project that you did?
- How closely did your final project reflect your initial design?
- What did you learn from this process?
- What was the hardest part of the final project?
- What would you do differently next time, knowing what you know now?
