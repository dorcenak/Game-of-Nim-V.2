‚ùó**References**: 
Throughout this project, you have likely used outside resources. Reference all ideas which are not your own, and describe how you integrated the ideas or code into your program. This includes online sources, people who have helped you, and any other resources that are not solely your own contribution. Update as you go.

## Milestone 1: Setup, Planning, Design

**Title**: 
  Game of Nim Mark II

**Purpose**: 
  Our project will work in the same manner as the original game of nim but with the change 
of making the code generate a random starting amount of balls.

**Sources**: 
  Our project will be based on homework 6: The Game of Nim.
**CRC Card(s)**:
  
![alt text](image/CRC.png "Image of CRC card as an example. Upload your CRC card(s) in place of this one")

**Branches**: 
1. Branch 1 name: kichemy-branch
2. Branch 2 name: DACC-branch

## Milestone 2: Code

No README action items. Keep your issue queue up to date, and focus on your code. üôÉ

Your repository should have, at a minimum, two branches; one for each partner, each with their contributions.

## Milestone 3: Virtual Check-In

Indicate what percentage of the project you have left to complete and how confident you feel. 

‚ùóÔ∏è**Completion Percentage**: 0 - 100%

‚ùóÔ∏è**Confidence**: Describe how confident you feel about completing this project, and why. Then, describe some strategies you can employ to increase the likelihood that you'll be successful in completing this project before the deadline.

‚ùóÔ∏èKeep your issue queue up to date, and continue to refine your code!

## Milestone 4: Final Code, Presentation, Demo

### ‚ùóUser Instructions
In a paragraph, explain how to use your program. Assume the user is starting just after they hit the "Run" button in PyCharm. 

### ‚ùóErrors and Constraints
Every program has bugs or features that had to be scrapped for time. 
These bugs should be tracked in the issue queue. You should already have a few items in here from the prior weeks. 
Create a new issue for any undocumented errors and deficiencies that remain in your code. 
Bugs found that aren't acknowledged in the queue will be penalized.

### ‚ùóReflection
In three to four well-written paragraphs, address the following (at a minimum):
- Why did you select the project that you did?
- How closely did your final project reflect your initial design?
- What did you learn from this process?
- What was the hardest part of the final project?
- What would you do differently next time, knowing what you know now?
