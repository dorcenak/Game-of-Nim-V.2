## Milestone 1: Setup, Planning, Design

**Title**: 
  Game of Nim Mark II

**Purpose**: 
  Our project will work in the same manner as the original game of nim but with the change 
of making the code generate a random starting amount of balls.

**Sources**: 
  Our project will be based on homework 6: The Game of Nim.
**CRC Card(s)**:

**Branches**: 
1. Branch 1 name: kichemy-branch
2. Branch 2 name: DACC-branch

## Milestone 3: Virtual Check-In

️**Completion Percentage**: 70%

**Confidence**: We are pretty confident right now in finishing the project on time. The strategy we will be using to move forward as fast as possible is the top-down design.

## Milestone 4: Final Code, Presentation, Demo

### User Instructions
When the game starts there will be a text displaying a welcome message. After that, the program will prompt the user to enter their name. After that, the user will read the instructions that will be displayed. The next scene would be the game, where they ask the user to select the number of balls they want to remove. If entered a number lower than 1 or higher than 4, the program won't let them move forward. When lost, they have the option to restart the game. The quit option is available in all the scenes in case they user wants to quit the game.

### Errors and Constraints
We created the necessary issue queues for any bugs.

### Reflection
In three to four well-written paragraphs, address the following (at a minimum):
At first, we wanted to choose a straightforward project. However, when we were thinking about it, we noticed that the project can be simple to run into the console, but it won’t be that simple to implement into the GUI window. Later on, we chose the Game of Nim, not because of its simplicity but because of its closeness to what we call “Games.” Additionally, it was the assignment we understood the most.

The new design overall is substantially different from that of the original. Our goal for this project was to make the game more user-friendly, and we achieved that by implementing the game into a screen pop-up rather than just simple printed input texts.

Overall, we learned a lot. The project allowed us to make practical use of window and button commands on Pycharm. But mainly, the project forced us to use nearly everything taught over the course of the semester, making us memorize and use self-statements, while loops, for loops, tk, and ttk tkinter commands, etc.

The hardest part of the project was trying to get our code to continue after announcing to the user how many balls they would start off with. During the very beginning of the project, this was one of the most significant issues that we ran into at the time.

One thing that we felt that we could have done differently was our work ethic. Due to our differing schedules, we often had to make use of partner programming to complete the project. The final couple weeks of classes are a hectic time for all. However, we could have handled the matter more smartly.
