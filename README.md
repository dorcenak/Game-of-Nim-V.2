## Milestone 1: Setup, Planning, Design

**Title**: 
  Game of Nim Mark II

**Purpose**: 
  Our project will work in the same manner as the original game of nim but with the change 
of making the code generate a random starting amount of balls.

**Sources**: 
  Our project will be based on homework 6: The Game of Nim.
**CRC Card(s)**:

2. Branch 2 name: DACC-branch

## Milestone 2: Code

No README action items. Keep your issue queue up to date, and focus on your code. üôÉ

Your repository should have, at a minimum, two branches; one for each partner, each with their contributions.

## Milestone 3: Virtual Check-In

Indicate what percentage of the project you have left to complete and how confident you feel. 

Ô∏è**Completion Percentage**: 70%

**Confidence**: We are pretty confident right now in finishing the project on time. The strategy we will be using to move forward as fast as possible is the top-down design.

## Milestone 4: Final Code, Presentation, Demo

### User Instructions
When the game starts there will be a text displaying a welcome message. After that, the program will prompt the user to enter their name. After that, the user will read the instructions that will be displayed. The next scene would be the game, where they ask the user to select the number of balls they want to remove. If entered a number lower than 1 or higher than 4, the program won't let them move forward. When lost, they have the option to restart the game. The quit option is available in all the scenes in case they user wants to quit the game.

### Errors and Constraints
We created the necessary issue queues for any bugs.

### ‚ùóReflection
In three to four well-written paragraphs, address the following (at a minimum):
- Why did you select the project that you did?
- How closely did your final project reflect your initial design?
- What did you learn from this process?
- What was the hardest part of the final project?
- What would you do differently next time, knowing what you know now?
